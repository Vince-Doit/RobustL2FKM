Improving projected fuzzy K-means clustering via robust learning

This repository hosts the code for the paper titled "Improving Projected Fuzzy K-Means Clustering via Robust Learning," published in Neurocomputing in 2022. The paper addresses the challenge of noise and outliers, which have  limited the performance of fuzzy K-Means clustering.

The repo also hosts some baseline systems as we compared in the paper. We would like to thank the authors of the baseline systems for their codes. If any baseline systems cannot be licensed freely here, please drop me an email, so we can remove it from the collection.

If you find this repo useful, please kindly cite the paper below.
